A simple 1v/oct synth using op-amps

This project is a version of the 1v/oct synth from [DIY Synth Series Part 1 - The Exponential VCO](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/diy-synth-series-vco/) modified to use the TL084 and to fit into a 12hp module.

In addition this module has a multicolor LED that lights depending on the CV and GATE values.
